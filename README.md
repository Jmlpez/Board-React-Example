# Board example

## Styles

Background color of the Board : `#3f3f3f`.

Background color of the board cells: `#5e5e5e`.

## Board Component

The component has 3 props: `row`, `col`, `size` and they are used to calculate the dimension of the board.

The row and col property are the amount of cells vertical and horizontally respectively. a.k.a the dimensions.

Example: a Board of 5x3 cells

The size property is an object:

```
size: {
    value: 50,
    margin: 2,
}
```

This two attributes are the size of the cells and the margin.

You can change the board as you like!. Have fun 😁😁
